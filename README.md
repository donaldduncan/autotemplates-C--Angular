## Autotemplates Trello Power-Up
# C# backend - Angular frontend version

I worked on this before leaving the NBS, the intention was for them to host it to replace a GScript automation I had running from a Google Docs spreadsheet.

After leaving the NBS, I wanted to turn it into an official Trello Power-Up, so this was abandonned in favour of a Node JS version, which you can see in the other repo.
